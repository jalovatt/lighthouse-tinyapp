# TinyApp

This project aims to replicate the behavior of URL-shortening sites like https://goo.gl/.

Once registered, users can shorten URLs, view URLs they've shortened along with visitor data for each, edit URLs, or delete them entirely.

## Usage

- Clone and `npm install` this repository.
- `npm start` to start the server (uses _nodemon_).
- Direct your web browser to [localhost:8080/](localhost:8080/)
